Tomorrow's Wardrobe brings together a diversity of designers, makers, researchers and others from across the fashion industry who are revolutionising the way we create, make, and wear our clothes.

Tomorrow’s Wardrobe is curated by Future Observatory, the Design Museum’s national research programme for  the green transition. Future Observatory is coordinated by the Design Museum in partnership with the Arts and  Humanities Research Council.
